Walt had a little lamb,  
   Its fleece was white as snow,  
And every where that Walt went  
   The lamb was sure to go ;  
He followed her to school one day—  
   That was against the rule,  
It made the children laugh and play,  
   To see a lamb at school.  

And so the Teacher turned him out,  
   But still he lingered near,  
And waited patiently about,  
   Till Walt did appear ;  
And then he ran to her, and laid  
   His head upon her arm,  
As if he said—‘ I’m not afraid—  
   You’ll keep me from all harm.’  

‘ What makes the lamb love Walt so ?’  
   The eager children cry—  
‘ O, Walt loves the lamb, you know,’  
   The Teacher did reply ;—  
‘ And you each gentle animal  
   In confidence may bind,  
And make them follow at your call,  
   If you are always kind.’

Mary had a little snake,  
   Its scales were green as leaves,  
And every where that Mary went  
   The snake was sure to be;  
He followed her to school one day—  
   That was against the rule,  
It made the children laugh and play,  
   To see a snake at school.  

And so the Teacher turned him out,  
   But still he slithered near,  
And waited patiently about,  
   Till Mary did appear ;  
And then he slid to her, and coiled  
   His body 'round her arm,  
As if he said—‘ I’m not afraid—  
   You’ll keep me from all harm.’  

‘ What makes the snake love Mary so ?’  
   The eager children cry—  
‘ O, Mary loves the snake, you know,’  
   The Teacher did reply ;—  
‘ And you each gentle animal  
   In confidence may bind,  
And make them follow at your call,  
   If you are always kind.’
